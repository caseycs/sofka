//! Repairs cursor-key escape sequences split at a read boundary.
//!
//! While mouse capture is released — document and log views release it so
//! click-drag uses the terminal's native text selection (#133) — terminals
//! translate the wheel into cursor-key escape sequences in the alternate
//! screen ("alternate scroll"): `ESC [ A`/`ESC [ B`, or `ESC O A`/`ESC O B`
//! in application cursor mode.
//!
//! Under a fast scroll burst a read can end exactly on the `ESC` byte. With
//! nothing else buffered the parser has to commit, so it reports a bare `Esc`
//! and then re-starts on the tail, which no longer looks like a sequence and
//! comes through as plain `[` and `B` characters. In the log view that stray
//! `Esc` closed the view and the tail then hit table bindings, landing on some
//! unrelated resource (#152).
//!
//! [`Repair`] puts the sequence back together: an `Esc` is held back for one
//! event (or a few milliseconds — see [`Repair::TIMEOUT`]), and if the
//! introducer and a final letter follow, the three are turned back into the
//! cursor key they came from.
